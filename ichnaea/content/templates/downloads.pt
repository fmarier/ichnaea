        On March 13th 2024 it was announced that Mozilla Location Service will be sunset. Details can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/ichnaea/issues/2065">announcment here</a>.

    <h3>Cell Networks</h3>

    <p class="text-justified">
        We export both a daily snapshot of the entire cell network collection
        as well as hourly differential updates. File names contain either the
        word <i>diff</i> or <i>full</i> to specify their type. The full cell
        export is limited to those cell networks whose position has been
        confirmed in the last 12 months.
    </p>

    <h4>Full Cell Exports</h4>

    <ul tal:condition="files.full">
        <li tal:repeat="file files.full">
            <a href="${file.path}">${file.name}</a> (${file.size}kB)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Differential Cell Exports</h4>

    <div class="half-left" tal:condition="files.diff1">
        <ul>
            <li tal:repeat="file files.diff1">
                <a href="${file.path}">${file.name}</a> (${file.size}kB)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="half-right" tal:condition="files.diff2">
        <ul>
            <li tal:repeat="file files.diff2">
                <a href="${file.path}">${file.name}</a> (${file.size}kB)
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h3>WiFi Networks</h3>

    <p class="text-justified">
        The combination of a MAC address and a location is considered
        personal data in some jurisdictions, as it contains data about
        the owner of a WiFi network. The collection of this data is
        legal as long as an effective <a href="/optout">opt-out</a>
        mechanism like the one we follow is provided. Lookups of individual
        WiFi records are prevented by the service by requiring a combination
        of two matching nearby WiFi networks in queries.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justified">
        We do not share data about WiFi networks. Sharing such data could
        expose personal data and make it possible to track the movements
        of WiFi networks over time.
    </p>

    <h3>Observations</h3>

    <p class="text-justified">
        In addition to the aggregate network data, the service also gathers
        the raw observation data these aggregates are based on.
        While we do not store any individual user token with the
        observation data, the data itself contains plenty of unique
        characteristics, locations and timestamps that would allow someone
        to track the movements of the people contributing observations
        to this service.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justified">
        We have therefor chosen to use a conservative approach and do not
        make the raw observation data public.
